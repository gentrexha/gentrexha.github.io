Tools used: Tableau 2019.2 & MS Paint.

Inspired by a Reddit visualization and this [guide](https://www.sirvizalot.com/2016/03/color-popularity-for-new-cars-2000-2015.html) I gave a shot in visualizing the rankings of the more known Albanian higher institutions in Albanian and Kosovo based on the world-wide Webometrics rankings published recently. I had to add the legend on the right side of the visualization manually in MS Paint, because I couldn't get it to work how I wanted in Tableau.
