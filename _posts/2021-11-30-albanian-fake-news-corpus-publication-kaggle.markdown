This dataset was derived from the publication 'Albanian fake news detection' by ERCAN CANHASI, REXHEP SHIJAKU, and ERBLIN BERISHA. Their GitHub Repository can be found at this [URL](https://github.com/rexshijaku/alb-fake-news-corpus) and their soon-to-be-published work may be found at this [URL](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qZZcuZ7GmxBPiyvS-m8yPzlkJIRo4_MQ/view?usp=sharing).


This dataset is made up of a small corpus of news that the authors of the study manually assessed as fake or not. The Figure below depicts the entire corpus formation process:

I was delighted to discover the authors' work and wanted to publish it in a DataFrame-friendly style so that others may build on it.
