I made this as part of a Data Mining course I took at the University of Prishtina, where we had to do a project on Data Stream Mining with a colleague of mine. We took the list of all candidates from Election Commission and linked them to their respective Facebook pages; furthermore we noticed that a lot of the candidates of the smaller municipalities weren't represented on social media, which is why we focused on the seven big cities of Kosovo. Moreover, we are looking into possibilities of generating election outcomes based on this social media activity.
