The Kosovo Agency of Statistics (ASK) recently published some very interesting data on the "Number of registered enterprises by municipality and sector of economic activity", which shows a very high intensity of new business registered in Prishtina. Even though, in Prizren for example the population is almost equal as big.

Sadly, in the data only the numbers for the first quarter of 2019 are included. Moreover, the data for the second quarter is all missing values! I've sent them an email regarding the topic, unsurprisingly they didn't reply. 

It would be very interesting to get data for earlier years as well, considering that the data exists on the [World Bank Open Data website](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IC.BUS.NREG?locations=XK). The closest thing to this indicator in the data portal of ASK is "The number of new and *re-registered* enterprises by quarters and sections of economic activities", which can be considered somewhat similar, excluding the re-registered part.

One would expect those numbers to be similar, right? After all, how many re-registrations could there be each year? According to the numbers, around 6500 businesses were re-registered during 2016 in Kosovo!? I really doubt this matches reality. I mailed them about this topic as well, and as expected no response about this as well.

Undoubtedly the same data in two different places tell two different stories. Which is a shame, because the data on the World Bank Open Data website portrays Kosovo worse in the innovation sector than it actually is.
