As the upcoming parliamentary elections of the 6th of October in Kosovo are coming closer, more and more of the election campaign is happening in social media as well. Considering the big internet penetration, this is definitely a worthwhile strategy.

Therefore, we (me and my colleagues Ilir Osmanaj & Princ Mullatahiri) decided to scrape some numbers of Facebook and try to get an insight into how the election field is looking over at social media. And, it's very interesting to say the least.

We would also like to know if there would be interest in publishing a similar analysis for more candidates, where one would be able to compare and analyze more different candidates in a dashboard. Let us know! 

Tools used: Python, R & Paint.net
